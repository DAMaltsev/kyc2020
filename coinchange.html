                    <p>We were driven by a compliance philosophy but completely unaware of the friction and hassle the wrong sanction screening tool could create.</p>

                <p class="p_reg">
                    In an industry where the vast majority of crypto and blockchain firms are either purposefully evasive of compliance or see it as an unnecessary cost of doing business, Coinchange demonstrated a unique culture of compliance. Following best practices, Coinchange adopted an AML policy that required Fuzzy screening of watchlists beyond just OFAC – from global sanction and Canadian PEP to Regulatory Authority and HIO – they wanted to be an exemplary case of compliance success in their industry.

                <p class="p_reg">
                    Coinchange had an incredibly successful product launch in 2022. In fact, their yield products were so appealing that the platform had more than 50,000 registration requests within 10 days of launch. Coinchange quickly realized their existing watchlist screening solution could not keep up with the pace needed to onboard so many new customers. Coinchange’s prior screening service was unable to automate 90% of client onboarding requests – that is, 45,000 of the fuzzy searches had an average of three name variant matches (‘hits’) per name screened and all required manual review. This meant having to manually clear more than 135,000 hits – a process that would take more than 1,000 person-hours. What made matters worse was that 99% of the hits were being cleared as false positives. The manual process of documenting and storing these false positives was time-consuming and was taking attention away from more important tasks that prevent fraud and financial crime.

                    <p class="p_reg">Unlike traditional score-based screening tools, DecisionIQ uses the power of AI to auto-clear false positives on fuzzy search and deliver real-time screening decisions – which are marked as “PASS”, “FAIL”, or "VERIFY”. Most useful to Coinchange was DecisionIQ’s innovative verifiable auditability, which provides an explainable proof of decision for each screen and ensures total clarity and control.</p>

                <div class="col-12 mt-5 mb-md-50">
                    <p class="p_reg">Upon implementing the technology, DecisionIQ automated 47,000 screens and 94% of the client onboarding requests were auto cleared against watchlists. While these results were extremely promising, KYC2020 knew that 3,000 screens would still require manual review, which would have taken too long and might have negatively impacted the customer experience.</p>

                        <p>A compelling part of the technology is that it provides a proof of decision for every screening decision. We liked this feature because unlike other 'black-box' AI solutions, KYC2020 approach is similar to blockchain concept of transparency via 'proof of work.</p>

                        KYC2020’s Rapid Review and Clearing System, solves the slowdown caused by case management systems that are not ‘human factored’ for large volume reviews. RABBIT is equipped with built-in functions for visualizing and processing information at scale, and, as a result, is a better, faster bulk review system.

                        Similarly, the launch of Watchdog in 2022 improved DecisionIQ technology to handle edge cases in AI that result in false positives. Watchdog tech stack is designed around Human Intelligence (HI) and includes a hit pattern recognition system, Contextual AI to predict gender and nationality of names, and a proprietary name relevancy scoring system that is more effective and intuitive than fuzzy scoring. This additional intelligence is used as part of a rulebased system to lower the rate of false positives caused by borderline cases that humans can detect better than AI. Watchdog further reduced false positives by 15%, resulting in autoclearing of more than 97% of screens — all of which are supported by a clear proof of work for verifiable auditability.
